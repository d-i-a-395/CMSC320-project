# CMSC320 Project: Mushroom Classification 🍄🍄‍🟫

## Checkpoint 1

For this project, we chose to analyze a [mushroom classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification/data).

Motivations:
* Allows us to help foragers avoid making lethal mistakes and recognize non-poisonous mushrooms
* Help humans who are possibly stranded without food to be able to survive safely by identifying poisonous mushrooms in their environment
* Help businesses who wish to start selling unique types of mushrooms without any harm

Whether collecting mushrooms is a hobby, last-resort, or a career choice, we can use the data set to gauge a stronger understanding of the characteristics of mushrooms to help people make safer decisions.
